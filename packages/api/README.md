# @rivus/api

Rivus REST API — [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) on MongoDB Atlas via
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com), with JWT auth and an OpenAPI document
generated from [Zod](https://zod.dev) route schemas.

## Architecture

Routes depend on **repository interfaces**, not on Mongoose directly:

- `repositories/memory.ts` — in-memory stores used by the test suite and for
  running the API without a database.
- `repositories/mongo.ts` — Mongoose-backed stores used in production.

`buildApp(deps)` wires the Fastify instance from injected dependencies, so the
full HTTP surface is tested with `app.inject` and no live MongoDB.

## Accounts, members & roles

Signing up creates three records in one Mongo transaction: a **User**, a
business **Account**, and an owner **Membership**. Every user belongs to exactly
one account, and the account owns all of its members' data. The JWT carries the
caller's `accountId` and `role`, and `requireRole(...)` guards enforce it.

Roles, in ascending privilege:

- **Team Member** — works in the account's data; no member management.
- **Manager** — additionally invites/removes Team Members.
- **Owner** — full control: manage all roles, billing, deleting the account.
  The last remaining owner can't be removed or demoted.

Members are added via tokenized invites (`POST /v1/members/invites` →
`POST /v1/auth/accept-invite`). Email delivery is not wired up yet, so the invite
token is returned in the response for the inviter to share.

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm --filter @rivus/api dev      # watch-mode dev server (needs MongoDB)
pnpm --filter @rivus/api test     # run the hermetic test suite
pnpm --filter @rivus/api build    # bundle to dist/ with tsdown
pnpm --filter @rivus/api openapi  # regenerate openapi.json for the docs site
```

Start MongoDB locally with `pnpm services:up` from the repo root. Configuration
comes from environment variables — see `.env.example`.
